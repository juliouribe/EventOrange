/*
Hosting Mini Lecture

When running locally, we run both a frontend and backend server. Frontend is at
localhost 3000 and backend is at 5000. We only need a server for frontend locally
because we are having a live development server to update with our changes. In
production we don't need a frontend server, just a static html page.

Need to add linux to Gemfile.lock
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux

Make sure public folder is in .gitignore
